## 🏛 About Us

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the **KAIST School of Computing Student Council**.
We are the representative body for all undergraduate students majoring, double-majoring, or minoring in Computer Science at KAIST.

Our Executive Committee strives to modernize student governance by adopting the tools we use in our studies—**Git, Open Source, and Collaborative Workflows**. We aim to replace opaque administrative processes with transparent, code-based solutions.

### 🎯 Our Mission

1. **Transparency:** Managing bylaws, budgets, and meeting minutes via version control.
2. **Efficiency:** Automating student welfare services (e.g., Locker Allocation System).
3. **Community:** Building a knowledge base for CS students to survive and thrive.
